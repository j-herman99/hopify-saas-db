# 🤝 Contributing – Hopify SaaS DB Generator

This project builds a fully simulated SaaS business database inspired by companies like Shopify. It generates realistic customer journeys, churn, retention metrics, support data, and more — all designed to support analytics, dashboarding, and portfolio development.

While the project was created for individual use, I welcome feedback, ideas, and collaboration.
