**Version:** `v1.0`  
📅 Released: May 2025


A Python-based generator that creates a realistic, benchmark-aware **B2B SaaS customer lifecycle database** for Hopify. It simulates acquisition, subscriptions, churn, and segment behavior across `SMB`, `Mid-Market`, and `Enterprise` tiers, producing a normalized SQLite database for downstream analysis.

---

## 🧠 Overview



This repository generates a clean, multi-year, segment-aware **SQLite database** (`hopify_saas_v1.db`) that serves as the foundation for SaaS KPI modeling, churn analysis, and revenue forecasting. The dataset is fully synthetic and reflects real-world B2B customer behavior.

It is designed for use by **data analysts, business students, and product teams** looking to practice SQL, Python, cohort modeling, and SaaS metrics in a realistic simulation environment. Built entirely in Python with optional visuals and benchmark targeting, it enables faster prototyping and hands-on exploration of customer lifecycle analytics.
